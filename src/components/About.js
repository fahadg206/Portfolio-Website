              I'm Fahad Guled, a Full-Stack Developer. In mid-2021, I made a
              bold move, transitioning into tech and embarking on a self-taught
              coding journey. My passion for tech and a desire to push my limits
              fueled this transition. Along the way, I've honed the ability to
              swiftly grasp new concepts, applying them to real-world apps. I've
              also embraced the importance of enjoying the learning process.{" "}

              <p className="sm: my-[30px] indent-7">
                But that's not all â€“ my experience with Fantasy Pulse, a
                substantial app, has been instrumental in shaping me into the
                developer I am today. I've gained valuable real-world experience
                by actively addressing user-submitted bugs to optimize user
                engagement, & leading the creation of a dynamic sports-tech
                application currently serving over 500 users! This is just the
                beginning of my software engineering journey! ðŸš€
