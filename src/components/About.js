              I'm Fahad Guled, a Full-Stack Developer. In mid-2021, I made a
              bold move, transitioning into tech and embarking on a self-taught
              coding journey. My passion for tech and a desire to push my limits
              fueled this transition. Along the way, I've honed the ability to
              swiftly grasp new concepts, applying them to real-world apps. I've
              also embraced the importance of enjoying the learning process. But
              that's not all â€“ my experience with Fantasy Pulse, a substantial
              app, has been instrumental in shaping me into the developer I am
              today. This is just the beginning of my software engineering
              journey! ðŸš€
